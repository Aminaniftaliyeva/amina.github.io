                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This personal website presents me as a creator and highlights my journey with projects. This is my third project, developed in Cursor, and it represents a significant milestone in my learning journey. Through this website, I showcase my work, share my accomplishments, and demonstrate my growth as a developer and creator.</p>
                
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>This website features my three main projects, each representing a different stage of my learning journey:</p>
                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li><strong>How Does Hardware Works?</strong> - My first project exploring logic gates and hardware fundamentals through hands-on breadboard experiments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hour of Code</strong> - My second project where I collaborated with Team 43 to teach AI literacy to 6th grade students at Lachin School No.45 in Bilajari.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Website</strong> - My third project, which you are currently viewing. This website itself is a demonstration of my ability to create, manage, and present my work professionally.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Development Process</h2>
                <p>This website was created using <strong>Cursor</strong>, an AI-powered code editor that helped me build and refine the project. The development process involved several key steps:</p>
                
                <h3>Using Cursor</h3>
                <p>I developed this entire website in Cursor, leveraging its AI capabilities to help with code generation, debugging, and optimization. Cursor allowed me to work more efficiently while learning best practices in web development.</p>
                
                <h3>Connecting to GitHub</h3>
                <p>I connected this project to GitHub to manage version control and showcase my work. Setting up the repository, initializing Git, and learning to use version control was an important part of this project.</p>
                
                <h3>Uploading Projects</h3>
                <p>I carefully uploaded all my projects to GitHub, organizing them properly and ensuring each project was well-documented. This process taught me the importance of proper project organization and version control.</p>
                
                <h3>Writing Prompts Independently</h3>
                <p>One of the most valuable aspects of this project was learning to write clear and effective prompts. I wrote all prompts by myself, carefully crafting instructions that would help me achieve the desired results. This skill has proven essential in working with AI tools and communicating my ideas effectively.</p>

                <h2>Learning to Write Prompts</h2>
                <p>Through this project, I learned how to write prompts clearly and effectively. I discovered that good prompts require:</p>
                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li>Clear and specific instructions</li>
                    <li>Well-structured requirements</li>
                    <li>Context about what I want to achieve</li>
                    <li>Attention to detail in describing desired outcomes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This skill has not only helped me in this project but will be valuable in all my future work with AI-assisted development tools.</p>

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                <ul class="project-list">
                    <li>Responsive design that works on all devices</li>
                    <li>Project showcase with detailed pages for each project</li>
                    <li>About section with my academic background</li>
                    <li>Direct contact through email integration</li>
                    <li>Social media links to GitHub and Codecademy</li>
                    <li>Clean, professional design that reflects my personal style</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Technologies & Tools</h2>
                <p>This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a modern, interactive web experience. The project was developed in Cursor and is hosted on GitHub, demonstrating my ability to work with modern development tools and version control systems.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>By creating this personal website, I proved to myself that I can independently manage projects, connect them to GitHub, and write clear prompts. I learned how to present my work professionally and gained confidence in my ability to grow as a creator. This project represents not just a website, but a journey of learning, self-discovery, and professional development. It showcases my ability to take on complex projects, learn new tools, and create something meaningful from start to finish.</p>
